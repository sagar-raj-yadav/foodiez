      "Barbecue is more than just a cooking method; it's a tradition that brings people together. This post explores the two primary techniques used in BBQ: smoking and grilling. While both methods involve cooking over fire, they offer distinctly different results.

We'll break down the pros and cons of each method, provide tips on choosing the right wood or charcoal, and offer advice on temperature control.
